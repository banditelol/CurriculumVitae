My Bachelor Thesis titled "Implementation of Hazardous Chemical Detection using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle" is a project done with a team of three people (me and two of my friends) and collaborating with two teams of graduate students also by a defense research institution in my city (Bhimasena). This thesis is done as part of a 3 years joint research between my University and Bhimasena, with the objective of developing a UAV with capability to augment military personel in detecting chemical contamination in war zone. Our team's goal is to develop a proof of concept of using a stable UAV to survey a certain region to detect it's chemical contamination level. To do so, we do preliminary study on what makes a stable UAV and the type of UAV which match the kind of payload we'll use.
